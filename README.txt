=== Release notes ===

This is experimental. It is a highly changed version of the scheduler code base.

There are many areas of the original code base that have not been altered, and
many other areas that have been totally removed.

Here is a list of overall @todos - there is probably more. This is alpha code.

1. Remove JavaScript hacks that are relied upon for saving teacher comments.
2. Make the "Students who still need to make an appointment" section a separate tab.
3. Verify that capabilities are properly setup and checked at the correct point in the code.
4. Test group functionality - remove it or make it work.
5. Add warning message on slot delete action.
6. Make integration with calendar smarter / more efficient.
